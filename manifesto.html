<body>
We make the hard, easy.
We make the impossible, possible.


We look at different things.
We look at the same things differently.


We speak at least three languages.
Code, business and our native tongue.


We know everything about some things.
We know something about most things.
We want to know more.


We value logic.
We appreciate abstractions.
We enjoy the logic inside the abstraction.


We care about what we build.
We value our impact on customer success.
We drive innovation, and learn from mistakes.


We change what people think.
We change how businesses work.
Sometimes, we change the world.
